# JonPertwee
Jon Pertwee is my 40ft boat, i am disabled Muscular Dystrophy. i have a great deal of work to do to make the boat sea worthy. i want to learn how to design the refit of the boat using some version of a CAD design program. i will be very grateful if someone could recommend a cheap or free CAD source. i have limited funds and to cap it all off the previous owner stripped the boat out after the sale but i cant prove a thing as there are no cameras at the moorings. thank you all for your time. P.S. i have limited experience with computers as i have always worked without them, so please treat me as a complete dummy.
